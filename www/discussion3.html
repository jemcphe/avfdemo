<h3>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?</h3>
<p>The top selling app categories in the United States are pretty obvious.  Social Networking, Games, then more utility applications</p>

<h3>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan?</h3>
<p>Gaming and utility are also at the top of Japan's app favorites.  Social Networking, however, was not as prevalent.</p>

<h3>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Great Britain?</h3>
<p>Gaming, utility, travel applications, and social Networking.</p>

<h3>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</h3>
<p>Gaming applications are obviously the favorite.  The United States and Great Britain were the most similar.  Japan similar in certain areas, however, you can see that they find more use in utility applications.</p>

<h3>What percentage of Android users have the latest/greatest OS in the U.S? in Japan? in Great Britain? How might these differences impact development?</h3>
<p>The latest/greatest Android OS in U.S. is about 11%.  Japan, a little bit less, at 9%. Great Britain, however, has a pretty good percentage, sitting at 23%.  Percentages in U.S. and Japan are pretty close, which would seem like a big impetence to me.  Developers will continue to make applications to cater to the largest OS in circulation, which hardly supports advancement and promotes complacency in development.</p>

<h3>What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets?</h3>
<p>The average cost for bandwidth in the United States and Great Britain are pretty similar.  The average cost is $1 - $5/1mbps.  Japan, however, has a cost of less than $1/1mbps.</p>
<h3>How may this impact development?</h3>
<p>This impacts the bandwidth availability for the developer.  This means that a developer in Japan, who is used to faster and cheaper speeds, will still have to cater to slower bandwidths if they want global acceptance.</p>
<h3>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</h3>
<p>A developer can be successful in all markets, however, I would put my focus in one area over another.  It is obvious that gaming is an important part of every market.  I would absolutely suggest creating a fun game for any of these markets, as their opportunity for being seen is much greater.</p>
