<h3>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible?</h3>
<p>I believe there is still much improvement that could be done to increase accessibility on my application.  The good news, thus far i suppose, is that my app is very simple.  Semantic HTML is present and I feel that the color scheme is very easy on the eyes.  I do need to take more time to include proper section tags and make the code look more "pretty".  On the developer side of things, I definitely could make better use of commenting.  Although the code is not tremendous, It would still be beneficial to comment before each section.</p>

<h3>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</h3>
<p>Common frustrations seem to stem from poor time investment into an application.  Not using the correct tags that are friendly with screen readers is a huge issue.  Developers should be constantly aware of every user from the blind and deaf, to the technologically-illiterate.  The problems could be avoided with better time management.</p>

<h3>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h3>
<p>I work in the wireless industry, and I see all sorts of devices.  One that really stands out to me is a device called the Pantech Coach.  This is just a simple flip phone that will make and take phone calls, however, it has some very interesting accessibility features.  This phone will allow the user to increase or lower the pitch of whomever they are speaking with.  It can also slow down the speech of the incoming voice for a better listening experience.</p>

<p>I also work alot with android devices.  I believe google has created a very accessibility-minded operating system.  Google has a very powerful voice recognition feature that allows the user to perform both common and complex tasks by simply speaking into the phone.</p>

<h3>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h3>
<p>I believe Google Drive is a good example of accessibility.  It allows users to very easily keep track of documents, photos, videos, powerpoints, etc...  This sort of application and use of cloud storage can come in handy when you need personal information right away.</p>

<p>I also think that the Native Settings on the Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwhich) has very good UI features that enhance accessibility.  For example, the user can change not only the font, but also the font size.  It may look a little ridiculous to some of us, but the text on their "HUGE" setting is very large and easily readable for most.</p>
