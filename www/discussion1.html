                What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only?
        </h3>
            <p>The native features that HTML/CSS/JS allow you to use on Android and iOS devices are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Camera</li>
            <li>Contacts</li>
            <li>Geolocation</li>
            <li>Network</li>
            <li>Media</li>
            <li>File</li>
            <li>Compass</li>
            <li>Accelerometer</li>
            <li>Storage</li>
            <li>Notifications</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            For your CRUD app revision and/or Demo App components, which of these do you think you will implement?
        </h3>
            <p>If i continue with my current CRUD app, I would use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contacts</li>
                <li>Media</li>
                <li>Network</li>
                <li>Notifications</li>
                <li>Storage</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            I am considering a new application for the Demo App and I would all of the above mentioned with Geolocation and Camera usage as well.
        </p>
        <h3>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.
        </h3>
        
        <p>The best advice I can give is to always start early on a project.  I would also say that using tools, such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, to hone in on the design is a great way to get started.  This will make your designs much clearer instead of trying to place divs and images and whatever without a solid plan... I am still working on this advice.  Much easier said than done, sometimes.</p>
        
        <h3>Please describe any design intentions you may have for the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app.
        </h3>
        
        <p>I have been seriously considering a new app for this Demo.  I know there will be alot of work to look forward too, but I feel like I have a pretty solid Idea for an app.  I would like to create an app that allows users to search a database, that is also user created, for an item/keyword they are looking to purchase.  For example, you want to buy your friend something, and you know that they love owl trinkets.  Well, where can I find something like that?  I don't know of any owl trinket store around the corner... but someone else may have found such a thing.  They can snap a pic of it, fill out a simple form, and upload it into a database that can be searched by anyone.  Seems like a very cool idea and I don't believe I have seen such an app.
